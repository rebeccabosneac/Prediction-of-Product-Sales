###  Rebecca Amaya
## For this project, my goal is to help predict Item Sales Prices using different features available on the data set.

This Heatmap shows a few moderate correlations which are: 
- Outlet_Establishment_Year has .52 correlation with Item_Weight
- Item_MRP has .57 correlation with Item_Outlet_Sales

This Boxplot shows that grocery store has the lowest sales of any outlet type and supermarket type 3 has the highest.
